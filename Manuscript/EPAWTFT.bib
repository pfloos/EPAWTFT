@article{Dirac_1929,
	abstract = { The general theory of quantum mechanics is now almost complete, the imperfections that still remain being in connection with the exact fitting in of the theory with relativity ideas. These give rise to difficulties only when high-speed particles are involved, and are therefore of no importance in the consideration of atomic and molecular structure and ordinary chemical reactions, in which it is, indeed, usually sufficiently accurate if one neglects relativity variation of mass with velocity and assumes only Coulomb forces between the various electrons and atomic nuclei. The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble. It there fore becomes desirable that approximate practical methods of applying quantum mechanics should be developed, which can lead to an explanation of the main features of complex atomic systems without too much computation. Already before the arrival of quantum mechanics there existed a theory of atomic structure, based on Bohr's ideas of quantised orbits, which was fairly successful in a wide field. To get agreement with experiment it was found necessary to introduce the spin of the electron, giving a doubling in the number of orbits of an electron in an atom. With the help of this spin and Pauli's exclusion principle, a satisfactory theory of multiplet terms was obtained when one made the additional assumption that the electrons in an atom all set themselves with their spins parallel or antiparallel. If s denoted the magnitude of the resultant spin angular momentum, this s was combined vectorially with the resultant orbital angular momentum l to give a multiplet of multiplicity 2s + 1. The fact that one had to make this additional assumption was, however, a serious disadvantage, as no theoretical reasons to support it could be given. It seemed to show that there were large forces coupling the spin vectors of the electrons in an atom, much larger forces than could be accounted for as due to the interaction of the magnetic moments of the electrons. The position was thus that there was empirical evidence in favour of these large forces, but that their theoretical nature was quite unknown. },

@article{Shanks_1955,
	abstract = {This paper discusses a family of non-linear sequence-to-sequence transformations designated as ek, ekm, {\~e}k, and ed. A brief history of the transforms is related and a simple motivation for the transforms is given. Examples are given of the application of these transformations to divergent and slowly convergent sequences. In particular the examples include numerical series, the power series of rational and meromorphic functions, and a wide variety of sequences drawn from continued fractions, integral equations, geometry, fluid mechanics, and number theory. Theorems are proven which show the effectiveness of the transformations both in accelerating the convergence of (some) slowly convergent sequences and in inducing convergence in (some) divergent sequences. The essential unity of these two motives is stressed. Theorems are proven which show that these transforms often duplicate the results of well-known, but specialized techniques. These special algorithms include Newton's iterative process, Gauss's numerical integration, an identity of Euler, the Pad{\'e} Table, and Thiele's reciprocal differences. Difficulties which sometimes arise in the use of these transforms such as irregularity, non-uniform convergence to the wrong answer, and the ambiguity of multivalued functions are investigated. The concepts of antilimit and of the spectra of sequences are introduced and discussed. The contrast between discrete and continuous spectra and the consequent contrasting response of the corresponding sequences to the e1 transformation is indicated. The characteristic behaviour of a semiconvergent (asymptotic) sequence is elucidated by an analysis of its spectrum into convergent components of large amplitude and divergent components of small amplitude.},

@article{Deur_2018,
	abstract = {Gross\textendash{}Oliveira\textendash{}Kohn density-functional theory (GOK-DFT) is an extension of DFT to excited states where the basic variable is the ensemble density, i.e. the weighted sum of ground- and excitedstate densities. The ensemble energy (i.e. the weighted sum of ground- and excited-state energies) can be obtained variationally as a functional of the ensemble density. Like in DFT, the key ingredient to model in GOK-DFT is the exchange-correlation functional. Developing density-functional approximations (DFAs) for ensembles is a complicated task as both density and weight dependencies should in principle be reproduced. In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. B 95, 035120 (2017)], the authors applied exact GOK-DFT to the simple but nontrivial Hubbard dimer in order to investigate (numerically) the importance of weight dependence in the calculation of excitation energies. In this work, we derive analytical DFAs for various density and correlation regimes by means of a Legendre\textendash{}Fenchel transform formalism. Both functional and density driven errors are evaluated for each DFA. Interestingly, when the ensemble exact-exchange-only functional is used, these errors can be large, in particular if the dimer is symmetric, but they cancel each other so that the excitation energies obtained by linear interpolation are always accurate, even in the strongly correlated regime.},

We outline the basics of a CC response theory framework that allows the transfer of the attractive accuracy and convergence properties associated with CC methods over to the calculation of electronic excitation energies and properties. Key factors affecting the accuracy of CC excitation energy calculations are discussed as are some of the key CC models in this field. To aid both the practitioner as well as the developer of CC excited state methods, we also briefly discuss the key computational steps in a working CC response implementation. Approaches aimed at extending the application range of CC excited state methods either in terms of molecular size and phenomena or in terms of environment (solution and proteins) are also discussed. {\copyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

Starting with basic quantum mechanics, the authors introduce the equilibrium and nonequilibrium Green's function formalisms within a unified framework called the contour formalism. The physical content of the contour Green's functions and the diagrammatic expansions are explained with a focus on the time-dependent aspect. Every result is derived step-by-step, critically discussed and then applied to different physical systems, ranging from molecules and nanostructures to metals and insulators. With an abundance of illustrative examples, this accessible book is ideal for graduate students and researchers who are interested in excited state properties of matter and nonequilibrium physics"--},

	abstract = { An analysis of the `linear combination of atomic orbitals' approximation using the accurate molecular orbital equations shows that it does not lead to equations of the form usually assumed in the semi-empirical molecular orbital method. A new semi-empirical method is proposed, therefore, in terms of equivalent orbitals. The equations obtained, which do have the usual form, are applicable to a large class of molecules and do not involve the approximations that were thought necessary. In this method the ionization potentials are calculated by treating certain integrals as semi-empirical parameters. The value of these parameters is discussed in terms of the localization of equivalent orbitals and some approximate rules are suggested. As an illustration the ionization potentials of the paraffin series are considered and good agreement between the observed and calculated values is found. },

@article{Vojta_2003,
	abstract = {In recent years, quantum phase transitions have attracted the interest of both theorists and experimentalists in condensed matter physics. These transitions, which are accessed at zero temperature by variation of a non-thermal control parameter, can influence the behaviour of electronic systems over a wide range of the phase diagram. Quantum phase transitions occur as a result of competing ground state phases. The cuprate superconductors which can be tuned from a Mott insulating to a d-wave superconducting phase by carrier doping are a paradigmatic example. This review introduces important concepts of phase transitions and discusses the interplay of quantum and classical fluctuations near criticality. The main part of the article is devoted to bulk quantum phase transitions in condensed matter systems. Several classes of transitions will be briefly reviewed, pointing out, e.g., conceptual differences between ordering transitions in metallic and insulating systems. An interesting separate class of transitions is boundary phase transitions where only degrees of freedom of a subsystem become critical; this will be illustrated in a few examples. The article is aimed at bridging the gap between high-level theoretical presentations and research papers specialized in certain classes of materials. It will give an overview on a variety of different quantum transitions, critically discuss open theoretical questions, and frequently make contact with recent experiments in condensed matter physics.},

Through algebraic geometry, the exact number of solutions with n basis functions is rigorously identified as 1/2(3n - 1), proving that states must exist for all molecular geometries. A detailed study on the h-RHF states of HZ (STO3G) then demonstrates both the conservation of holomorphic solutions as geometry or atomic charges are varied and the emergence of complex h-RHF solutions at coalescence points. Using catastrophe theory, the nature of these coalescence points is described, highlighting the influence of molecular symmetry. The h-RHF states of HHeH2+ and HHeH (STO-3G) are then compared, illustrating the isomorphism between systems with two electrons and two electron holes. Finally, we explore the h-RHF states of ethene (STO-3G) by considering the $\pi$ electrons as a two-electron problem and employ NOCI to identify a crossing of the lowest energy singlet and triplet states at the perpendicular geometry.},

@article{Carrascal_2015,
	abstract = {This review explains the relationship between density functional theory and strongly correlated models using the simplest possible example, the two-site Hubbard model. The relationship to traditional quantum chemistry is included. Even in this elementary example, where the exact ground-state energy and site occupations can be found analytically, there is much to be explained in terms of the underlying logic and aims of density functional theory. Although the usual solution is analytic, the density functional is given only implicitly. We overcome this difficulty using the Levy\textendash{}Lieb construction to create a parametrization of the exact function with negligible errors. The symmetric case is most commonly studied, but we find a rich variation in behavior by including asymmetry, as strong correlation physics vies with charge-transfer effects. We explore the behavior of the gap and the many-body Green's function, demonstrating the `failure' of the Kohn\textendash{}Sham (KS) method to reproduce the fundamental gap. We perform benchmark calculations of the occupation and components of the KS potentials, the correlation kinetic energies, and the adiabatic connection. We test several approximate functionals (restricted and unrestricted Hartree\textendash{}Fock and Bethe ansatz local density approximation) to show their successes and limitations. We also discuss and illustrate the concept of the derivative discontinuity. Useful appendices include analytic expressions for density functional energy components, several limits of the exact functional (weak- and strong-coupling, symmetric and asymmetric), various adiabatic connection results, proofs of exact conditions for this model, and the origin of the Hubbard model from a minimal basis model for stretched H2.},

	abstract = {The asymmetric Hubbard dimer is used to study the density-dependence of the exact frequencydependent kernel of linear-response time-dependent density functional theory. The exact form of the kernel is given, and the limitations of the adiabatic approximation utilizing the exact ground-state functional are shown. The oscillator strength sum rule is proven for lattice Hamiltonians, and relative oscillator strengths are defined appropriately. The method of Casida for extracting oscillator strengths from a frequencydependent kernel is demonstrated to yield the exact result with this kernel. An unambiguous way of labelling the nature of excitations is given. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem is proven for the groundstate exchange-correlation energy. The distinction between weak and strong correlation is shown to depend on the ratio of interaction to asymmetry. A simple interpolation between carefully defined weak-correlation and strong-correlation regimes yields a density-functional approximation for the kernel that gives accurate transition frequencies for both the single and double excitations, including charge-transfer excitations. Many exact results, limits, and expansions about those limits are given in the Appendices.},

Solutions of the Hartree-Fock equations for a single Slater determinant or approximate Hartree-Fock solutions obtained by Roothaan's iterative procedure have special properties which are used to simplify the matrix of the many-particle Hamiltonian. A restricted self-consistent field method is proposed for treating states of low symmetry. This method avoids the off-diagonal Lagrange multipliers encountered in previous methods and is adapted to configuration interaction calculations. },

	abstract = {For non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with an isolated degeneracy (`exceptional point'), a model for cycling around loops that enclose or exclude the degeneracy is solved exactly in terms of Bessel functions. Floquet solutions, returning exactly to their initial states (up to a constant) are found, as well as exact expressions for the adiabatic multipliers when the evolving states are represented as a superposition of eigenstates of the instantaneous Hamiltonian. Adiabatically (i.e. for slow cycles), the multipliers of exponentially subdominant eigenstates can vary wildly, unlike those driven by Hermitian operators, which change little. These variations are explained as an example of the Stokes phenomenon of asymptotics. Improved (superadiabatic) approximations tame the variations of the multipliers but do not eliminate them.},
